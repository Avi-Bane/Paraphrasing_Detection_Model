Paraphrasing detection Model
-------------------------------

Task Definition
Paraphrase detection is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining whether two sentences or phrases convey the same meaning. Given two input sentences, the model should predict whether they are paraphrases of each other or not.



Dataset
You'll need a dataset of sentence pairs labeled as either paraphrases (1) or not paraphrases (0). 

Dataset used:- Quora question pairs


Preprocessing
1. Tokenization: Split each sentence into individual words or tokens.
2. Stopword removal: Remove common stopwords like "the", "and", "a", etc. that don't add much value to the meaning.
3. Stemming or Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
4. Vectorization: Convert text data into numerical vectors using techniques like:
• Bag-of-Words (BoW)
• Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
• Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
Model Architecture
Choose a suitable model architecture based on your dataset and computational resources. Here are some popular options:
1. Siamese Neural Network: A neural network with two identical sub-networks that process the two input sentences separately. The output of each sub-network is then compared using a similarity metric.
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A CNN can be used to extract features from the input sentences, followed by a pooling layer and a fully connected layer for classification.
3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): An RNN can be used to model the sequential nature of language, with a variant like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to handle long-range dependencies.
4. Transformer-based models: Models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet have achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks, including paraphrase detection.
Training
1. Split data: Divide your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing).
2. Define a loss function: Use a suitable loss function like binary cross-entropy or mean squared error.
3. Optimize the model: Use an optimizer like Adam, SGD, or RMSProp to minimize the loss function.
4. Train the model: Train the model on the training set, monitoring the validation set performance to avoid overfitting.
Evaluation
1. Metrics: Use metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Testing: Evaluate the model on the testing set to estimate its performance on unseen data.
Hyperparameter Tuning
Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to optimize the model's performance.
Deployment
Once you've trained and evaluated your model, you can deploy it in a production-ready environment to classify new sentence pairs as paraphrases or not.
