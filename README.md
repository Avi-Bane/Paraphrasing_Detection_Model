Paraphrasing detection Model
-------------------------------

Task Definition
Paraphrase detection is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining whether two sentences or phrases convey the same meaning. Given two input sentences, the model should predict whether they are paraphrases of each other or not.



Dataset
We need a dataset of sentence pairs labeled as either paraphrases (1) or not paraphrases (0). 

Dataset used:- Quora question pairs


Preprocessing

1. Tokenization: Split each sentence into individual words or tokens.

2. Stopword removal: Remove common stopwords like "the", "and", "a", etc. that don't add much value to the meaning.

3. Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

4. Vectorization: Convert text data into numerical vectors using techniques:
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
â€¢ Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)


Model Architecture
Choosen a suitable model architecture based on dataset and computational resources.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): An RNN can be used to model the sequential nature of language, with a variant like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to handle long-range dependencies.


Training
1. Split data: Divide your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing).
